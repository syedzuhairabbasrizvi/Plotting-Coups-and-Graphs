To play game, open on VSCode and run. Instructions are provided ingame.

Required modules are Pygame, Pyvis, NetworkX. 
Other modules used are random and Webbrowser.

There is a rare occasion that the game may crash during playing.

Also, there are certain parts in the code that appear as links. These links were made
specifically for this laptop, so they would have to be updated according to which
path you download this file into. The comment "UPDATE PATH ACCORDING
TO YOUR DOWNLOAD LOCATION" pinpoints the locations of these links for
easy access. If that does not give you the links, search ".html" in VSCode and they
will appear.
